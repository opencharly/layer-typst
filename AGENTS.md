# AGENTS.md — layer-typst

Standalone candy repo for the `typst` layer — the Typst document processor
binary, fetched from GitHub releases. The candy lives in `charly.yml` at the
repo root: the `TYPST_VERSION` var, the `download:`/extract `plan:` step, the
`check:` assertions, and the embedded `skill:` entity projected into the
marketplace corpus as `/charly-coder:typst`.

Canonical files:

- `charly.yml` — the `typst:` candy entity and the `typst-skill:` skill entity.
- `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml` — CalVer tag + `CHANGELOG/` on merge.
- `README.md` — user overview only; never agent guidance.

## Load these skills first (R0)

- `/charly-coder:typst` — the owning skill. The binary, the pinned release, and
  the compile contract. Load before editing or troubleshooting the layer.
- `/charly-image:layer` — the candy authoring reference (`charly.yml` schema,
  `plan:` step verbs incl. `check:` and `download:`, per-distro `distro:` arms,
  package/repo sections, service declarations). Load before editing any entity
  field or plan step.

## Build / validate / test

- The merge gate is the **org-wide** `charly/pr-validator` (required check
  `validate / validate`, defined in `opencharly/.github`); this repo has **no
  per-repo candy gate** and ships only `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml`.
- The candy's `plan:` `check:` steps are the functional evidence. The `compile`
  check is the live proof — a non-functional binary fails it.
- `TYPST_VERSION` must stay a concrete tag, never `latest`: the `download:` verb
  content-addresses its cache by the URL, so a moving URL serves a stale tarball.

## Modify this repo

- Edit the `typst:` candy entity AND the `typst-skill:` skill entity in
  `charly.yml` together. The skill is the projected usage source, so a behaviour
  change not mirrored in the skill leaves the corpus stale.
- A version bump is a deliberate, sum-verified change to `TYPST_VERSION`; the
  download URL template and the `check:` assertions move with it.
- New behaviour claims belong in the `plan:` as an observable `check:` step, and
  in the skill body.

## Landing

- PR-only. Every change lands through a pull request; the org-required
  `charly/pr-validator` validates the diff and body and arms native auto-merge on
  PASS. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
- History lives in `CHANGELOG/` (written by `tag-on-merge` at merge time); the PR
  body IS the changelog.
- The authoritative rulebook is the umbrella `AGENTS.md` in
  `opencharly/opencharly` and `charly/AGENTS.md` in the charly repo. Do not
  restate its rules here.
